I am using Next.js(fullstack solution) because it is simple project and this is solution is perfect for this, but in a big and medium project i am using Next.js(fromtend) + asp net core(backend) + Postgress. I my opinion this stack is provide the most poverfull  combination for speed, security, perfomance and scalibility
